**Concordance Detector Application**    
This was used as a submission for a interview challenge. I challenged myself to use built in modules and tkinter as a result I'm not super happy with the code due to some trivial shortcomings of tkinter.  
  
**What?**    
-Fancy UI  
-Shows all found Concordances  
-Selecting a Concordance highlights all found in the text and lines they are found on  
    
**How to Run/Edit:**
